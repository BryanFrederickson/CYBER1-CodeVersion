## A collection of project files and documentation regarding the CYBER1-CodeVersion CPTS 421 group capstone project. ## 

# CYBER1-CodeVersion

Developers: Bryan Frederickson, Samantha Brewer (KleinMandolin)

## Project summary

### One-sentence description of the project

Develop a tool to generate unique permutations of a given C/C++ or Python source code file, where the outputs function the same as the original.

### Additional information about the project

This project is meant to help signature-based intrusion detection by being able to generate semantic copies of known code, to better identify malicious software that has been changed to avoid detection.

Rough prototypes can be found in the `python_notebook_tests` branch, which has been kept separate to ensure that main contains only accessible, functional code.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
These instructions are written for modern Windows. The Windows command line can be opened via typing ```cmd``` in the search bar of File Explorer or by searching in programs for Command Prompt.
1. Python3 - Can be installed in multiple ways. The easiest way for Windows is via [installers](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/). Check it's installed via ```python --version``` in powershell/command line.
2. LibCST - Installed in command line/powershell via ```pip install libcst```

### Add-ons

TODO: List which add-ons are included in the project, and the purpose each add-on serves in your app.
- As of Sprint 2, rough algorithmic testing is still being done. A user-friendly and acccessible program will be developed in Sprint 3, with the instructions for use being updated here.

### Installation Steps

TODO: Describe the installation process (making sure you mention `bundle install`).
Instructions need to be such that a user can just copy/paste the commands to get things set up and running. 
- As of Sprint 2, rough algorithmic testing is still being done. A user-friendly and acccessible program will be developed in Sprint 3, with the instructions for use being updated here.


## Functionality

TODO: Write usage instructions. Structuring it as a walkthrough can help structure this section,
and showcase your features.
- As of Sprint 2, rough algorithmic testing is still being done. A user-friendly and acccessible program will be developed in Sprint 3, with the instructions for use being updated here.


## Known Problems

TODO: Describe any known issues, bugs, odd behaviors or code smells. 
Provide steps to reproduce the problem and/or name a file or a function where the problem lives.
- As of Sprint 2, rough algorithmic testing is still being done. A user-friendly and acccessible program will be developed in Sprint 3, with the instructions for use being updated here.
