The `python-notebook-tests` branch contains a python notebook walkthrough of the `CST Renamer` found in the main branch, as well as an example test file made to test the Renamer's coverage of function or variable use cases (e.g. nested variable calls in `first.second.third` or function redefinitions and import aliases). For more information on the CST Renamer and the project in general, please navigate to the main branch.
