## Completed Issues/User Stories
Here are links to the issues that we completed in this sprint:
TODO
 * #3  - [Create a UI for Python file parameter input](https://github.com/BryanFrederickson/CYBER1-CodeVersion/issues/3)
   - Completed as part of larger completed Python Obfuscator GUI (see below). Implemented by selecting an 'Open' button that opens the OS's filesystem navigator for the user to select and input file, with robust error handling.
 
 ## Incomplete Issues/User Stories
 Here are links to issues we worked on but did not complete in this sprint:
TODO
 * #25 - [Fix Foreign Alphabet Translation](https://github.com/BryanFrederickson/CYBER1-CodeVersion/issues/25)
   - A new issue created after finishing the Python Obfuscator to address limitations in the current translation algorithm. Currently, translation replaces non-Latin characters with random Latin letters to solve issues regarding unsupported UTF-8 characters. Work will be done to better parse characters so that translation is accurate but functionality is preserved.
